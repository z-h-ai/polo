/**
 * Source-activation auto-restart drain controller (#790).
 *
 * When a session-scoped tool (`mcp__session__source_test`) successfully
 * activates a new source mid-turn, the agent must end the current turn so
 * the renderer can re-send the user's message with the new tools live. The
 * naive abort-on-first-tool_result path discards sibling tool_results from
 * the same parallel-tool batch, leaving Polo AI's session journal with orphan
 * `tool_use` IDs that block all subsequent sends.
 *
 * This controller defers the abort. The agent yields events normally but
 * tells the controller about each yielded event. The controller decides:
 *   - whether the agent should short-circuit normal per-event handling
 *     (inactive-source detection, compaction reset, large-result intercept)
 *     for events we're only draining
 *   - whether to fire `source_activated` + `forceAbort` at a boundary
 *
 * Two policies, picked at construction:
 *
 *   - `'batch-boundary'` (Claude): the adapted-event array is the natural
 *     batch. The Claude event adapter interleaves synthetic events
 *     (`task_backgrounded`, `shell_backgrounded`, `shell_killed`) between
 *     `tool_result` events within ONE SDK user message, so we must drain
 *     the whole batch before firing. Caller drives the fire via
 *     `shouldFireAtBoundary()` at end-of-batch and end-of-stream.
 *
 *   - `'fire-on-non-tool-result'` (Pi): the adapter is 1:1 with no
 *     interleaved synthetic events, so the first non-`tool_result` event
 *     after capture marks the start of the next assistant turn and is the
 *     natural drain boundary. Caller drives the fire via
 *     `shouldFireBeforeEvent()` before yielding each event.
